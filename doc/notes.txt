[ power consumption ]

total: 1.3mA @ 12V = 16mW (ldo)
mcu: 1.4 mA @ 3.3V = 4.62mW

total: 10mA @ 12V = 120mW (traco)

if LDO used, ((15 - 3.3) * 0.002) = 0.0234W
if DC/DC used, (12 * 0.01) - (0.0014 * 3.3) = 0.11538W

this traco module not made for low power application
since it drains at least 15mA with no load applied
